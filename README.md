Ideation & Validation
💭 How do I know if my startup idea is good enough?
The startup idea validation framework:

Problem Check

Can you explain the problem in one sentence?
Are people actively trying to solve this problem?
Would people pay for a solution?


Market Check

Total Addressable Market (TAM) > $1B?
Growing market or declining?
Any recent changes making solution more relevant?


Solution Check

10x better than existing solutions?
Can you build an MVP in 3 months?
Clear path to monetization?

"Nobody has done this before" (usually means no market)
"Everyone needs this" (too broad, no focus)
"Just like X but better" (incremental improvement only)
